# Installation instructions
---

The fastest way to get up and running is to dowload the [standalone test runner](http://download.cypress.io/desktop) and add this directory as a project. Run a test from `/integration/standalone-tests` 

If you want to run cypress from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html)
